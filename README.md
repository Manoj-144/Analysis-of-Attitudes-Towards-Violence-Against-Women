# Analysis of Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women

## About the Project

This project is a collaborative effort by **Manoj R** and **Pranav**, focusing on attitudes and perceived justifications for violence against women across African, Asian, and South American countries. The study leverages data to understand how factors like education, employment, marital status, and age influence these attitudes. It supports global efforts to eliminate violence against women by providing actionable insights for policies and awareness campaigns.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis was sourced from the [Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/violence-against-women-and-girls), which gathers population, health, and nutrition data to inform national and international policy-making.

## Analysis Performed

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Examined the distribution of responses based on sociodemographic factors.
   - Identified patterns and correlations between education, employment, and attitudes toward violence.

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Tracked changes in attitudes over time and across regions.
   - Highlighted key differences in perceptions between countries and continents.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created bar plots, heatmaps, and geospatial maps to showcase insights.
   - Visualized the impact of education and employment on attitudes.

4. **Policy Insights**:
   - Interpreted trends to provide actionable recommendations for awareness campaigns, education programs, and economic empowerment initiatives.

## Key Insights

- **Education**: Higher education levels significantly reduce justification for violence against women.
- **Employment and Empowerment**: Womenâ€™s economic independence correlates with decreased tolerance for violence.
- **Marital Status**: Attitudes vary by marital status, with cultural and regional factors influencing perceptions.
- **Global and Regional Trends**:
  - Cultural norms heavily influence attitudes in specific regions, necessitating tailored interventions.
  - Education and public awareness are critical in fostering societal change.

## Policy Recommendations

- **Promote Education**: Implement programs that enhance access to education for women and girls.
- **Awareness Campaigns**: Develop targeted campaigns to challenge harmful cultural norms.
- **Economic Empowerment**: Create initiatives supporting women's employment and independence.
- **Localized Interventions**: Customize strategies to address regional trends and cultural barriers.
